# Builder

To Start the builder app, Please run BuilderLanucher under src->main.java.

Then you can create a level by clicking the NEW PUZZLE LEVEL, NEW LIGHTNING LEVEL and NEW THEME LEVEL
button. You can create the levels in any order, however, in order to make the player run,
the levels are created in the order puzzle, lightning, theme, puzzle, lightning, theme and so on.
No level is created at the beginning of game.
If you exit the program with click on "X" all your progress will be saved.
Once you entered the data to update a new level, the data are auto-saved.
If you click the return button, the date you entered will NOT be saved.
You can re-edit the existed level by clicking the level button, the updated data will be auto-saved once you edit the level.

For your convenience to test NEW PUZZLE LEVEL, NEW LIGHTNING LEVEL and NEW THEME LEVEL button,
we have created two levels which are puzzle level and lightning level. Levels should be built in the order of puzzle, lightning, theme, puzzle, lightning, theme.

Attention:
In order to make the player run, please create the future levels in the SAME ORDER.

Once you have created fifteen levels, the data are already in the data file. Please copy the data from the data file into the CORRESPONDING player-data file. Player program will load the data from the player-data file.

To run your newly created levels in player application, you may want to restart the game in player to clear the old progress.

For your convenience to test player program, we have already put the data for player in the player-data file,
so you can run the player program directly without creating a new level in builder and copying data to player.

The created level can not be removed from the builder window, however, it can be re-edited by entering the corresponding level and entering the new data.

How to create a new level:
To activate a square on the board, click the square. Once the square turns to grey, it means that
this square is activated. Select a letter for that square.
In the right area, enter the data according to the instruction in the text field.
Clicking "SAVE" button: all the entered data will be saved to the data file.
Clicking "DELETE" button: all the existing data will be removed from the data file, and all the data will be set to default value.
Clicking "RETURN" button: all the entered data will NOT be saved, and all the data will be returned to the same value as the builder edited and saved last time.
*When you are creating a theme level, please ensure that you have entered the CAPITAL letters for the theme and the answer text field.
